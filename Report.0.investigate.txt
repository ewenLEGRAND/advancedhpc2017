Compilation
***********

	In order to compile this program and built it easier, I made a cmake 
with the following command :

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make -j 

	After that I can run the program by typing ./labwork . If I change the
program, I have to re-compile by typing "make -j" and re-run the program.

	To compile this program, I have to add an argument (1,2,3 ...) and the path
for the data which will be used in the program.

Inputs
******

	./labwork 
	
	./labwork 1 ../data/eiffel.jpeg

Outputs
*******

	USTH ICT Master 2017, Advanced Programming for HPC.
	Usage: labwork <lwNum> <inputImage>
	   lwNum        labwork number
	   inputImage   the input file name, in JPEG format
	
	This output is the output when you forget the arguments lwNum and 
inputImage.

	Warming up...
	Starting labwork 1
	labwork 1 CPU ellapsed 3017.5ms
	labwork 1 ellapsed 91.6ms

	This output is with lwNum (labwork number) equal to 1 and the eiffel
jpeg image. We mesure the time of the computation labwork1_CPU() function and
the time of the computation of labwork1_OpenMP() function. The result of the 
computation time seems correct but the second mesure, for the OpenMP function,
is not correct because this function is empty for now. I will have to complete
this function in the next labwork : Labwork 1.
