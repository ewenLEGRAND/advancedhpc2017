Mission
*******

        Thanks to the labwork 4 code, I have to realize a 7x7 Gaussian blur convolution.

How ?
*****

	 First, I have to define the matrix of the 7x7 gaussian filter. After that, I will
use the CPU convolution code and modify it with the parallel use of kernels.

	In my program, I will use two kernel. The first one is the kernel greyscaling that 
I already used in the previous labs. After that first image computing, I have to filter the 
device output image of the greyscaling kernel. So I use the device output of the greyscaling
kernel as the input for my filter kernel. 

	The filter kernel has two for loop in order to compute each pixel on the filter matrix
surface (7x7). There is 4 conditions (top, bottom, left and right side of the image) where I have 
to be carefull because of the filter matrix part which is out of the image matrix. In fact for the
pixels which are one the side of the image, there is a part of the matrix filter which is not into
the image dimension. In this case I choose to do nothing and to ignore these pixels (instead of 
mirror choice).
